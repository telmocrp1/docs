To use the Find Contacts API, you need to authenticate your requests using an API key. This key should be included in every request you make to our API.

## Getting Your API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. Sign up for an account at [Find Contacts Dashboard](https://dashboard.findcontacts.com)
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Generate a new API key

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If your key is compromised, you can generate a new one from the dashboard.
</Note>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the request header as `x_api_key`:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.revook.co/v1/findcontacts" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x_api_key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "domain": "example.com",
    "webhook_url": "https://your-webhook.com/endpoint"
  }'
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive this response:

| Status Code | Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | unauthorized | No credits left |

Example error response:

```json
{
  "code": "unauthorized",
  "message": "No credits left"
}
```
